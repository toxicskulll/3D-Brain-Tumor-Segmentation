    "# 3D Brain Tumor Segmentation using nnU-Net\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a state-of-the-art 3D brain tumor segmentation system using the nnU-Net framework on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Brain tumor segmentation is a critical task in medical imaging that helps radiologists and oncologists identify and measure tumor regions for treatment planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Brain Tumor Segmentation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Brain tumor segmentation involves automatically identifying and delineating different tumor regions in medical brain scans. The BraTS dataset focuses on gliomas, which are the most common primary brain tumors in adults.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Tumor Regions:\n",
    "- **Whole Tumor (WT)**: The complete tumor area including all sub-regions\n",
    "- **Tumor Core (TC)**: The tumor without the peritumoral edema\n",
    "- **Enhancing Tumor (ET)**: The actively enhancing tumor region\n",
    "\n",
    "### MRI Modalities Used:\n",
    "- **FLAIR**: Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery - highlights edema and non-enhancing tumor\n",
    "- **T1**: T1-weighted - provides anatomical structure information\n",
    "- **T1CE**: T1-weighted with Contrast Enhancement - highlights blood-brain barrier breakdown\n",
    "- **T2**: T2-weighted - shows edema and cystic components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Overview:\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**: Extract and organize BraTS 2021 dataset\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**: Combine modalities and prepare for nnU-Net\n",
    "3. **Model Architecture**: Implement NVIDIA's optimized U-Net architecture\n",
    "4. **Training**: Train the model with deep supervision and advanced techniques\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**: Assess performance using Dice coefficient metrics\n",

    "1. **Data Format Conversion**: Converting individual modality files into combined 4D volumes\n",
    "2. **Label Remapping**: Standardizing segmentation labels for consistent training\n",
